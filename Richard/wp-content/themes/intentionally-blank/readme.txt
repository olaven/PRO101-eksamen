This theme was intentionally left blank. There are times when all you need is the WordPress dashboard and an blank frontend.

== Description ==

You might be using the WordPress REST API as a backend for a mobile App or you might be a minimalism obsessed hipster. Blank's frontend it's a simple configurable welcome screen, while keeping the back-end fully funcional. 


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this a joke? =

Nope. It's a fully functional 8Kb theme. And it's really cool.

= Is it safe for production? =

Blank it's actually safer than all those bloated multi-purpose themes. There isn't much to break, and code follows WordPress good practices.

= Can you add [insert functionality here]? =

I probably can, but I probably won't. Blank serves a single pupose, closing the front-end, and it does that beatifully. If there's anything more you need, fork it or install a plugin.
