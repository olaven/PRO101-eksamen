This plugin creates a page template giving you a blank page so “the_content()” of the page is all that is displayed, no header, no footer.

== Description ==

This creates a page template giving you a blank page so only the content of the page is displayed. Header and footer are totally empty. This is great for page builders (Beaver Builder, Divi, etc), landing pages and squeeze pages.

== Other Notes ==

This plugin will load everything that is normally included in the wp_head() and wp_footer(), so all scripts should load as normal.
