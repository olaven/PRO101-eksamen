# follows:
#
# [mysqld]
# log-error=/Applications/wordpress-4.9.4-1/mysql/data/mysqld.log
#
# In case the root user has a password, then you
# have to create a /root/.my.cnf configuration file

#
# [mysqladmin]
# password = <secret> 
# user= root
#
# where "<secret>" is the password. 
#
# ATTENTION: The /root/.my.cnf file should be readable
