 == About the Author == 
 
Hi! My name is Gregor, I am born in Germany, I spend a lot of time creating WordPress themes when I'm not doing consulent work as a search engine optimization consultant. 
I learned to code so I was able to do on page SEO as well as off page. 
 
I often get questions if it's okay to fork the way I build features, my CSS and my php. 
The answer is short YES, you are always allowed to fork whatever code you want off my themes and create something amazing. 
WordPress wouldn't be able to exist without people co-creating things, so the only thing I ask in return, is that if you improve some of my code, please share it with me so I can implement it :D 
You can fork my entire themes and redesign them if you want, so no restrictions. 
If you have questions then you can always contact me via beseenseo@gmail.com then I'll do my best to help fellow develoers out 
 
Gregor over and out!
